Fifth file added in github local repo.

Let's talk about Error we face.

1.  GitHub online repo has one more file added comapared to this local repo.
       
       If you `git push` before `git pull` command at this stage.
       It will generate error as 

$ git push
To https://github.com/iamkrvikash/Git_Test.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/iamkrvikash/Git_Test.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.


2.  To sort this out.One has to Make the branch even by `git pull` then `git push` to push the new files.

3.  But let say you have commited as in this case before `git pull` command.
       After `git pull` Message will pop as 


Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/iamkrvikash/Git_Test into master
# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
#
# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts
# the commit.

To solve this issue, Enter a message. 
It comes as like vim editor,
